# E300PC
original Pascal and MODULA-2 code for the E300/E250 radar (see http://ewradar.com/)

This is some very old code written when I was 15 years old.  I still have a version that runs on a DOS simulator (though it only shows canned data).

Graphical Data Entry Manager (GDEM) 1.0 was a line-based digital map|geographic data entry and editing tool.

GDEM’s input was a set of coordinates manually entered from chart derived measurements.  Protractor coordinates.  Acetate.

GDEM would output a binary formatted map, based on a pre-defined schema, using a third party EEPROM reader that Arnold had found.

GDEM 1.0 was implemented as 300 lines of Commodore BASIC, which Derek had used with the eighth grade PET computers.  DATA statements.  GOSUBs.

DG was paid 200 in 1984 to produce GDEM 1.0.  The development was mostly in the spring and summer.

GDEM Version 2.0 was imagined as having graphical preview capabilities.  But E300PC happened instead.

RADARPAS was the name of the Turbo Pascal program that implemented the E300PC 1.0 product.  Hardware PC.

TurboPascal / OpenObject

RADARPAS’s input was data sent from the E300 radar system.  It would interact eith the system over a modem, abd then receive the current radar feed.

RADARPAS graphics library allowed visualization of radar images with a map overlay.

Implemented in Turbo Pascal.  EGA Hayes Racal-Vadic.  Graphics Communication Control GUI modules.  Functions.  Interrupts.

DG was paid 600 in 1985 to produce RADARPAS.  This gave Ellason rights to sell as many copies as he wanted.

DG made RADARPAS 2.0 with save and load options.  The upgrade to 2.0 earned Derek 800 each.
